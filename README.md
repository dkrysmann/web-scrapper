Python bs4 prices scrapper

For some time I wanted to know if bike prices change over time. Especially I was interested in seasonal fluctuations.
Therefor I created this python code which I run once a week and store date in a CSV file to analyse it later.
The scrapper is available as a python script and as a Jupyter Notebook.
